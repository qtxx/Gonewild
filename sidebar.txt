######rules
1. **Read [the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/wiki/faq) before commenting or posting**. This sidebar is the TL;DR, but you're still obligated to follow the guidelines and the general spirit of the FAQ.
2. **Report any comments or threads you find abusive.** We check the reported queue often. If you come across a user being mean spirited or posting personal info, click the report link. When you argue with a troll, you are entering a competition to see who has more free time. You will lose, because you have a life and the troll does not. **Do not EVER respond to trolls. Instead, report them!**
3. **Be respectful.** Don't insult the ones brave enough to submit photos / videos. If you don't want to see dicks then don't open the ones with the [male] tag... it'll likely be dicks.
4. Don't make creepy, threatening, or malicious comments. Don't be an asshole or crash our party with your drama. **Respect the anonymity of our users or be banned.** If you link to another user's personal info / content outside reddit--if you so much as try to guess a name--you will be shown the door.
5. The Reddit spam filter sometimes mistakenly nabs perfectly genuine non-spam posts. If you think a submission of yours or someone else has been filtered, please contact the moderators.
6. **Please add a [male] or [female] tag in the title of your submission(s).** Feel free to be creative and play with this tag. A [CD] (cross dresser) tag, [t] (transexual) tag,  or simply a [?] are also admissible, with the understanding that if someone clicks on a [?] they don't mind a surprise. :)

> If you use reddit to sell panties, fetish items, cam shows, or anything similar, and wish to post to Gonewild, please do so under a separate account. We wish to remain separated from all money-making endeavors, so that Gonewild remains a purely exhibitionists subreddit where people post for absolutely no other reason than the thrill of it.
